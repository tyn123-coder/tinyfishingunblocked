            The FBI has also been unable to unlock the iPhone of the Mayor of

            <small>Saturday, Oct. 05, 21:00h</small><br />
            By TN Agency
          </p>
          <p class="intro-text">
            One day after changing his phone password, the Mayor of New York
            City told the FBI that he had forgotten the new password. A year
            later, the FBI still hasn't been able to unlock the phone.

          <p>
            In November 2023, New York Mayor Eric Adams was stopped by FBI
            agents on the street after attending a public event. Initially, he
            insisted that he "had nothing to hide" and committed to cooperating.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, the case became complicated as Adams submitted two phones
            to the FBI. But neither of them was the device he used to
            "communicate about the violations in the indictment," according to
            prosecutors.
          </p>

          <p>
            The next day, Adams brought his personal phone to the FBI at their
            request, but the device was locked. The mayor stated that he could
            not remember the password, even though it had been set just a day
            before. Until now, nearly a year later, the FBI still hasn't been
            able to unlock this phone.
          </p>
          <h2>Changing Password Just Before the Arrest</h2>

          <p>
            According to court documents, Adams stated that he changed his
            password right after learning about the investigation. Fearing that
            data on the phone might be deleted by members of his team, he
            changed the password from four digits to six digits to "secure
            important information." However, the next day, he could not remember
            this password.

          <p>
            This has led many to question the honesty of Adams's testimony.
            Prosecutor Hagan Scotten described this as a "volatile move" by
            Adams, potentially having serious implications for the case.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a hearing at the federal court in Manhattan, Scotten emphasized,
            "Decoding will always catch up with encryption, but we won’t know
            anything until we can access the device."

          <p>
            However, experts assess that decrypting Adams's phone is not easy.
            According to the New York Post, there have been instances where the
            FBI has unlocked similar devices using technology from the Israeli
            company Cellebrite, but Adams's personal phone, with its strong
            encryption, remains a "significant challenge."
          </p>

          <p>
            Adams claims that forgetting the password was merely an accident.
            But with the allegations surrounding his involvement in corruption
            related to bribery from foreign sources, this has raised public
            skepticism.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is just the tip of the iceberg. Besides Adams "forgetting" his
            password, the 57-page indictment presents a plethora of evidence
            showing that his associates deliberately concealed criminal
            activities.
          </p>

          <p>
            In one interview with the FBI, an employee of Adams requested to
            step outside to use the restroom. There, she deleted encrypted
            messaging apps she had used to communicate with Adams and other
            partners.
          </p>

          <p>
            Among them were a Turkish official and an aviation manager. Adams
            himself had previously instructed another employee to "delete all
            messages sent to me," with a brief note: "Always remember to do
            that."
          </p>

          <h2>The FBI's Challenges</h2>

          <p>
            According to the indictment, those around Adams organized
            fundraising events that were purportedly legal. But in reality, they
            were a means to receive illegal foreign donations from Turkey.
          </p>

          <p>
            One event organizer even created a fake PowerPoint presentation to
            cover up the true nature of the event as a fundraiser for Adams's
            2025 campaign. Another important detail is that during key meetings
            regarding issues related to Turkey, Adams and his associates left
            their phones outside the meeting room to avoid recording the
            conversation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Adams's inability to provide the password for his phone has raised
            many suspicions. Is this truly an accident, or a way to obstruct the
            FBI's investigation? In previous cases, there has been considerable
            debate about whether defendants have the right to refuse to provide
            phone passwords.
          </p>

              alt="The FBI has also been unable to unlock the iPhone of the Mayor of

            />
          </figure>
          <p>
            Some courts have ruled that the right to remain silent under the
            Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits investigators
            from forcing suspects to disclose their phone passwords.
          </p>

          <p>
            Phone passwords are often considered a form of "testimonial
            evidence" because they require a person to reveal their thoughts.
            However, if Face ID or Touch ID is enabled on Adams's device, the
            FBI could unlock his phone using biometric data, which is generally
            not regarded as a form of testimonial evidence.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is not the first time the FBI has had to deal with a locked
            iPhone. They just need the right tools. After investigators in
            Pittsburgh were unable to access the phone of a shooter at a Trump
            rally, they sent the device to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia.
          </p>

          <p>
            Agents unlocked it in under an hour, using an unreleased tool from
            the Israeli company Cellebrite to gain access to the shooter's
            phone.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, experts told the New York Post that breaking into Adams's
            phone would be "extremely difficult" for the FBI.

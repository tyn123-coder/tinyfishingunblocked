            Durov's life is cloaked in an idealized image. However, his ex-lover
            has exposed a life of luxury, abuse, and failure to provide child
            support.

          <p>
            Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of Telegram, has long been known
            for his image as a principled and powerful entrepreneur. His
            messaging app, Telegram, has become one of the most popular
            platforms globally, boasting millions of users thanks to its
            commitment to security and privacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, few are aware that behind this success lies a complex life
            with his ex-lover, Irina Bolgar.
          </p>
          <h2>Lawsuit after lawsuit</h2>
          <p>
            According to Bolgar, her relationship with Durov lasted nearly a
            decade. During that time, they lived an astonishingly luxurious
            lifestyle. The couple reportedly spent $1 million each summer to
            rent a sprawling 469,000-square-meter resort in Sardinia, Italy.
          </p>
          <p>
            They owned a beachfront penthouse in Dubai with a private elevator
            and frequently traveled by private jet to Paris, Monaco, and many
            other lavish destinations. All of this is just a part of the picture
            of the regal life they shared together.

          <h2>A Complex Life</h2>
          <p>
            However, according to Bolgar, Durov began to change over time. From
            a principled man she once admired, he transformed into a controlling
            and abusive figure. In the criminal complaint Bolgar filed in
            Switzerland, she alleged that Durov physically abused their youngest
            son five times in 2021 and 2022.
          </p>

          <p>
            On one occasion, he hit the child on the back, causing him to fly
            away. On another, he shook the boy so violently that his shoes fell
            off. He even grabbed the child's legs and threatened to kill him.
          </p>

          <p>
            These details have been documented in legal filings. A spokesperson
            for Durov denied the allegations, asserting that the incidents
            Bolgar mentioned "never happened" and that the accusations are
            "baseless."
          </p>

          <h2>Prosecution and Financial Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>
            According to the New York Times, Durov is currently facing
            prosecution in France for illegal content on Telegram. He is accused
            of facilitating the spread of materials related to child abuse, drug
            trafficking, and fraud. The founder of Telegram could face many
            years in prison if convicted.
          </p>

          <p>
            Adding to the complications, Bolgar also accused Durov of failing to
            meet his financial responsibilities to their children. According to
            documents related to the criminal complaint, Durov has not paid
            child support. This means that even if he finds a way to overcome
            the charges in France, he will still face legal issues elsewhere.
          </p>

          <h2>A Lesser-Known Life</h2>
          <p>
            Bolgar's story has unveiled the lesser-known life of Durov. Always
            keeping his private life under wraps, he is one of the most powerful
            figures in the tech industry but remains relatively unknown to the
            public, the New York Times noted.
          </p>

          <h2>Austere Image vs. Lavish Lifestyle</h2>
          <p>
            Bolgar described Durov as a two-faced man. He always presents
            himself as a defender of free speech, but in private, he is entirely
            different. "Durov's image as a defender of freedom crumbled when you
            see his private life. It shows the stark contrast between his public
            words and his actual actions," she said.
          </p>

          <p>
            A spokesperson for Durov stated that Bolgar and he "were never a
            couple." She allegedly misused the millions of dollars he provided
            in child support. She spent extravagantly on luxury items and
            expensive travel.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Durov has several children and supports each with $10,000 a month.
            He hopes the Swiss justice system will clarify the truth so that
            this money is used for its intended purpose: to support the
            children,” the spokesperson said.
          </p>

          <p>
            Durov has long been known for his austere lifestyle. However,
            according to Bolgar, he enjoys a lavish life. Durov once sent her a
            message about staying in a $20,000-a-night hotel in Dubai and
            boasted about the enormous sums he earned from Bitcoin.
          </p>

          <p>
            “I can do that because I made tens of millions of dollars easily
            from Bitcoin,” Durov wrote in the message.
          </p>

            />
          </figure>
          <p>
            Moreover, he is very concerned about his image, always obsessed with
            maintaining his physique and often taking photos with models in
            swimsuits to post on social media. He once messaged her: "Come see
            how the people on the Forbes rich list live.”
          </p>

          <p>
            However, their relationship began to deteriorate in 2021 when Durov
            became aggressive and started exhibiting abusive behaviors towards
            their children. Bolgar stated that he began to control and threaten
            her, even threatening to cut off all financial support if she did
            not comply with his demands. After enduring this for a long time,
            she decided to file a criminal complaint against Durov in March
            2023.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bolgar also provided substantial evidence of their relationship,
            including invoices for lavish vacations and notarized documents
            committing to financial support of up to €150,000 per month.
            Accompanying this were numerous photos of them together, from
            smiling on private jets, celebrating birthdays, to traveling around
            places like Italy, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates.
          </p>

          <p>
            When Bolgar publicly accused him, Durov claimed he is the father of
            over 100 children worldwide due to being a sperm donor. Bolgar
            immediately responded by posting a picture with their children,
            emphasizing: "We must always take responsibility for our children.
            That is the difference between a sperm donor and a father.”
